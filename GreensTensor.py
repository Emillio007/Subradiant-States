GREEN'S TENSOR (in free space)
In this section, the Green's tensor for the i'th dipole w.r.t. the j'th dipole is calculated.
The assumptions include:
 * Markovian regime: I.e. the bandwidth of atomic transition, w0, is small and the retardation of the field is negligible.
 * Free space: I.e. the Green's tensor is calculated in free space, where the dipoles are tightly trapped, i.e. d < lambda_0.
 * The stroung coupling regime is avoided: I.e. the electromagnetic field is not strongly coupled to the atomic transition (CQED).
 * The dipoles are point-like particles: I.e. r_i and r_j can be treated as fixed position vectors.
